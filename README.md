# SD-card-back-up-and-resize
simple bash script to SD card back up and resize via CLI
I needed to do periodic backups of my headless raspberry pi  serving as a nas and syncthing server for my home network.
This script is a simple script that backs up a live sd card image to a mounted hdd drive with the host name and date added.
The sd card resize script then resizes the image to it's least possible filesize. The script is edited from a sd card resize script I had found on the Raspberry Pi forums a few years ago. Not able to find the actual source now to give it, its due credit.
